###### I can not get PGAdmin to connect to AWS RDS? Some Stack overflow answers said to change my pg_hba.conf file but I couldn't find that in my files. Anothe rcomment said it's due to my inbound rules on AWS but I followed the module exactly and it won't connect to the IPv4 or IPv6 connections, and even when I try custom connections, it gives an error message for every single one. 

###### Still trying to figure it out
